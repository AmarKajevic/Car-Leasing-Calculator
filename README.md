Explanation of the project: 
I used HTML to create the basic structure of the form, labels, input fields (for car value and down payment), range sliders, and dropdown menus (for car type and lease period). 
Style the form using CSS and implemented responsive design for mobile resolutions.
I used TypeScript to handle the input changes and perform calculations. Capture user inputs for car type, car value, lease period, and down payment.
Based on the car type, apply the appropriate annual interest rate 2.99% for new cars and 3.7% for used cars, also calculated the down payment amount and the loan amount.
Compute the monthly installment and calculate the total leasing cost over the lease period.
